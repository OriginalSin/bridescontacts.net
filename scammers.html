																	<b><span class="title black">Too Good to be True</span></b>
																	<span class="news"> -  These women are trying to correspond with as many men as they can. Because of that their letters are often surprisingly impersonal and vague when it comes to specific questions. If women avoids using your name or worth still - uses a wrong one, if she is not answering your questions or gives very general answers than it is a first <b><font color="#EB1217">RED FLAG</font></b>.</span> 
																	<p class="news"><b>They also do not have time to waste!</b><br><br>They will reply with enormous joy and happiness that you wrote to them. After a few more e-mails they are completely head over heels in love with you! The photographs they use (which are not necessarily <i><b>their</b></i> photographs) are of a very beautiful women. Being realistic (unless of course you are Brad Pitt or Sean Connery) - does not this instant &#147;love at first sight&#148; sound a bit unusual to you? This is a second <font color="#EE0005"><b>RED FLAG.</b></font><br><br>This brisk set up serves as a jumping point to the real thing.<br><br><b><font color="#EE0005">RULE#1: If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</font> </b></p>

																	<b><span class="title black"><font color="#000000">Money, money, money...</font></span></b>
																	<span class="news"> -  OK, mutual love has been established. Now they are starting to explain how hard it is for them to keep in touch with you via e-mail as the <b>costs of the Internet</b> (translator, telephone, photographs...) are high and if you wish to continue this correspondence could you please help them with these costs.</span>
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news">Or her computer has suddenly crashed and to fix it she needs just ridiculous $70 which she does not have. Just send some money by Western Union to keep a romance alive. Not much (from your point of view) only 50 (70, 100) dollars. However, to a very pretty lady who is weekly getting 100's of letters from dozens of men it might be a very healthy income, taking into account that the average wage in Russia is around $300 - $500 a month.</span> 
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news">Another favourite trick of the scammers is to go quiet for a while keeping your guessing - what could possibly happened over there? Then, out of the blue, they will write to you about a <b>horrible accident happened</b> (or about to happen) to them (family member, friend...). Mother who needs urgent surgery in a hospital is an undisputed winner. And yes, you are, of course, the only one who can help them out. This time you will be looking at $300 - $1000 depending on the set up and her greed.</span>
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news"><b>Any, and we wish to stress this in the strongest words possible, ANY AT ALL request for money is the most red flag out of all <font color="#EF330E">RED FLAGS.</font></b></span>

																	<b class="title black">Air Tickets, Visa, Customs duty</b>
																	<span class="news"> -  This is an ultimate goal for every scammer - to clean man on<b> an airfare</b>. The Holy Grail of all introduction scams. Latest scammers' trend is to ask for only part of airfare. Here is a part from a real e-mail: <b>&#147;To come to you I need only tickets and if you'll help me with part of cost of my tickets I can come to you.&#148;</b></span>
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news">Ironically, this is the easiest scam for you to avoid. In order to visit you in Australian or US, woman has to have a <b>valid Australian, US, UK or NZ entry visa</b>. And this is a hard thing to get for a young and single Russian lady. We wish to make the following point absolutely clear - it is a very common misconception that you can just buy an Australian or US entry visa in Russia. <b>No!</b> It is a complicated and some times long process and the very last thing it depends upon - is money. Remember - <b>your money can not get visa for her. Don't be fooled.</b></span>
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news">There is a very simple way to see whether she is genuine. To be on the safe side you should: </span>
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news"><img src="img/galka_transp.gif" width="10" height="10"> Offer her to <b>buy air ticket in Australia yourself</b> and then send it over to her with a courier.</span>
																	<br>
																	<span class="news"><img src="img/galka_transp.gif" width="10" height="10"> Ask her to send you a fax or e-mail with a scanned copy of her passport page with attached <b>valid entry visa</b> in her name.</span>
																	<br><br>
																	<span class="news">If her intention is really to visit you and she has a valid entry visa to do so then she should be only too happy to delegate the whole thing to you. But if she insists on money versus ticket, becomes offended, refuses to give her visa details, then it does not look too good...</span>
																	<p><b>Some other common fishing tricks scammers use:</b></p>
																	<p>
																	  <span class="news"><img src="img/galka_transp.gif" width="10" height="10"> Needs money to show on Russian border to Russian customs. <font color="#EF330E"><b>RED FLAG</b></font></span>

																		<b><font color="#EF330E">RULE#3: Never send money for airfare. Never send money for visa support. Always check for a valid entry visa first.
