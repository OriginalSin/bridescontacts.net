                                        Hi, my name is <b>Vladimir Korovine</b> 
                                        and I am running this Russian brides introduction 
                                        service in Australia since year 2000. 
                                      </p>
                                      <p>During all these years, while I was growing 
                                        this business here, in Melbourne, I was 
                                        getting a lot of emails from all around 
                                        the world about the <b>&quot;dark side&quot; 
                                        of Russian women Internet introduction</b>. 
                                        Many of my current customers have suffered 
                                        disappointments before they found our 
                                        site. Many of them were scammed. And many 
                                        of them eventually shared their experiences 
                                        with me.</p>
                                      <p>After a while I decided to research this 
                                        ugly subject myself. So I did. As I know 
                                        very well how the things are really working 
                                        in introduction industry, so it was extremely 
                                        easy for me to spot a bogus website or 
                                        a false claims on a seemingly legitimate 
                                        website right away. </p>

                                        from making wrong decisions. It takes 
                                        a lot of time and a lot of work.<br>
