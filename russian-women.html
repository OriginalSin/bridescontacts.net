							  The most common complaint we hear from men is 
							  the limited selection of suitable partners in 
							  Australia. </p>
							<p>We think the reasons there are so few good 
							  women to choose from are two-fold. </p>
							<p><img src="/images/1.gif" width="25" height="25" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;First, 
							  men aren't stupid. We know a good woman when 
							  we have one, and we hold on to her. Thus the 
							  choice is limited considerably by marriage and 
							  serious long-term relationships. </p>
							<p><img src="/images/2.gif" width="25" height="25" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;The 
							  second reason is the feminist movement has corrupted 
							  a significant portion of western women in general 
							  and Australian in particular, and turned them 
							  into androgynous drones. </p>

							<p><b>The main difference between Russian women 
							  and Australian women is that Russian women do 
							  not suffer from the Cinderella syndrome common 
							  to Australian females.</b></p>
							<p><img src="/images/3.gif" width="25" height="25" align="absmiddle">&nbsp;Running 
							  a close third is the career woman. Right or 
							  wrong, her career is her priority. </p>
							<p>It's ludicrous to claim that all Russian women 
							  are beautiful and feminine, or all western women 
							  are ugly and feminists. There is a mix of good 
							  honourable women and bad disreputable women 
							  in every region of the world. However, there 
							  are a few generalities worth mentioning. </p>
							<p><img src="/images/galka_transp.gif" width="10" height="10"> 
							  The true feminism is prevalent among Russia 
							  women; the main focus of Russian women feminism 
							  is revealing in womanhood. It's quite refreshing. 
							</p>
							<p><img src="/images/galka_transp.gif" width="10" height="10"> 
							  For the most part Russian women really take 
							  care of their personal appearance. </p>

							<p><img src="/images/galka_transp.gif" width="10" height="10"> 
							  Also, Russian women walk extensively, they eat 
							  responsibly, and they dress impeccably. </p>
							<p>Russian women are more than just pretty faces 
							  atop nubile bodies. They are real people with 
							  all the advantages and disadvantages that come 
							  with being human. Each is an individual. Russian 
							  women exist in every imaginable form: from physical 
							  stature to personality type, intellectual level 
							  to emotional disposition, and/or every possible 
							  combination of these traits. </p>
							<p>In fact, the variety of Russian women is just 
							  as diverse as are men's preferences. </p>
							<p>Therefore, whatever traits or characteristics 
							  you are looking for can be found in Russian 
							  women.</p>
							<p>The key for the man is to understanding his 
							  own personality and needs well enough to separate 
							  the wheat from the chaff. </p>
							<p>The fact is - many Australian men interested 
							  in Russian women have had a divorce. These men 
							  are sick of the values of those of the women 
							  who have divorced them. They want to try something 
							  new. They still have a wide range of qualities 
							  in regards to their attractiveness, financial 
							  circumstances, age, etc. </p>

							<p>However, the chances to find a woman 10-15 
							  years younger for them is slim in Australia; 
							  it is not so typical of Australian society (unlike 
							  of Russia, where 10 - 15 years of age difference 
							  considered as a norm). </p>
							<p>Sometimes we come across a stereotype that 
							  Russian women is a solutions to the problem 
							  of someone incapable of finding him a partner 
							  here in Australia. A &quot;loser&quot; of a 
							  kind. </p>
							<p>We tend to disagree. </p>
							<p>A man, who has so much adventure in him that 
							  he is willing to try something new, visit a 
							  foreign country and marry a young and beautiful 
							  foreign woman, is hardly what can be called 
							  a &quot;loser&quot;. </p>

							<p>A &quot;loser&quot; more likely will sit at 
							  home in quiet desperation and become a grumpy 
							  couch potato, or go to the local pub and drink 
							  till he is blind. A loser does not do the proactive, 
							  creative sort of thing, which is required to 
							  marry a foreign bride, in particular one from 
							  a country as different as Russia. </p>
