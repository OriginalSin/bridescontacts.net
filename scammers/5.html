										Hello my sweet Love David!
Your letter I always cheers me up and makes my day brighter. I'm so glad always read your words of love and tenderness. I want now to be in your arms and enjoy our love.
My sweet Love David, today I learned how I can come to you and I to do this. When I went to the travel agency, I came under the snow and cold. Now it's cold outside and the weather is cloudy. I would be very happy if you and I could go together to the beach to sunbathe and swim in a little hot weather, it would have been for me the greatest happiness. We could take a walk around the city, and then to go home and I was made for you and me a romantic dinner, and when we went to bed with you, then make love until morning. I very much hope that we will meet with you and carry out all of our dreams and desires.
As I already told you, I now go to a travel agency and find out how I can come to you and I to do this. I spent a lot of time at a travel agency and found out all the full information. My sweet Love David, I do not even know me to rejoice or cry from what I have learned as I can come to you. The travel agency told me that I need to do a visa, and some other documents, do it all quickly and easily, but I was very confused by the price of these instruments. I did not expect that the price of my trip to you will be so big. In order for me to do a visa do I need to pay 95 euro, 85 euro passport, medical certificate of 70 euro, 65 euro insurance and pay a state fee of 50 euro. The total cost of all these documents is 365 euro. All these documents will be made within 7 - 10 days, it is very fast.
My sweet Love David, unfortunately I can not pay the cost of my visa and documents, so I do not have so much money. My salary is only 210 euro per month, and of the money I pay bills for the apartment. I do not know what to do. I'm hoping for something that I can come to you and that we will be together with you to create our happy family and enjoy our love. I ask you to excuse me for what I have 365 euro to I could do with the visa documents and come to you. If I had money, I would now like to run a travel agency and started to do the visa documents and would have come to you.
I love you very much and I want to be with you. I'm sick of the fact that we're not together right now, but I hope that you will not get mad at me that I can not come to you. What should I do? I heart it hurts not only the thought that we'll never meet again and will not be together.
My sweet Love David, no matter what I want you to know, and remember always that I love you very much with all my heart and soul, and I will love you always. You're the man who owns my heart. I want to be only with you. I do not need anyone but you. I'll be a lot to think about you and miss you and your kisses.
I sweet kiss you in your sweet lips.
Your Love Irina.
